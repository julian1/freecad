  - having earthed copper - is a path for body surface capacitance - as well as coil capacitance.

  - for the 1of3. having two flanges each side - means can put copper/tape between them
      even if takes more space.
      it doesn't look like can squeeze.

  - we could reduce space for the flanges - by making a complete unit.


- there is actually a small lip - that  reduces body contact.
- having some small recesses - would be nice for alignment - but would interfere with a copper sleave between them.


  - so do the single body  - as a test.
  - and 3x smaller bobbins.  with 1mm. separation.



nylon.  natural grey.   no surface finish.

1.2 wall.   so would need 2.93 / 2.

1x bobbin/ thick wall
  ((6.5 * 2) + 1.5 + 1.5) * 1
  16

3x bobbins. thin wall
  1.2 wall. 1.46 height.  on both sides.
  ((1.46 * 2) + 1.2 + 1.2) * 3
  15.96

2x bobbins. thin wall
  ((2.8 * 2) + 1.2 + 1.2) * 2
  16

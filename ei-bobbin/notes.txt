  - there are 4 separate supplies - analog, iso, analog 5V.  ER/digital.

  - think it may make sense to wind all 4 coils - secondaries - for analog, and iso. - on the same bobbin.
      so there will be some capacitive coupling. but does it matter.


  - We can wrap tape 360 degrees.  fully around the bobbin.  but remember 1kV. needed between ER,

  - We could add the 5V digital rail - as the immediate next  bobbin to the primary - for better HV isolation.
      Or just copper on the inside.

  -

  - one do make an entirely metal version -  eg. stainless.
      - and with a slot to avoid a shorted turn.
      - no good for HV.
      - issue is the digital supply. would need to be separate.   but it could be plastic.

      - could even be a kind of box.


  - having earthed copper - is a path for body surface capacitance - as well as coil capacitance.

  - for the 1of3. having two flanges each side - means can put copper/tape between them
      even if takes more space.
      it doesn't look like can squeeze.

  - we could reduce space for the flanges - by making a complete unit.


- there is actually a small lip - that  reduces body contact.
- having some small recesses - would be nice for alignment - but would interfere with a copper sleave between them.


  - so do the single body  - as a test.
  - and 3x smaller bobbins.  with 1mm. separation.



TODO
  - slightly thinner - to accomodate pcb guard ?  eg. 2x 0.6mm.
  - one of the inside lengths - needs to be about 1mm. longer - to match the Bel former.



nylon.  natural grey.   no surface finish.




jlcpcb.  tue. jul 2 2024.
  submitted.  watch time 7.44pm. 4.44pm shenzhen.
  go through checkout. and select shipping etc.  but instead order goes to review before paying.
  initially state
  state 4-6 hours during business
  8.05pm approved. good.

  ------

  was able to use 'add item' to 'combine' the third item in a new cart. to the already successfully reviewed other items in cart.
  instantly went into 'reviewing'

  ----
  paid 6.46pm.   shenzen time. eg. 45mins after cutoff.

  hmmm says 'in production'  so perhaps they started anyway.


we have 16mm height.


1x bobbin/ thick wall
  ((6.5 * 2) + 1.5 + 1.5) * 1
  16

3x bobbins. thin wall
  1.2 wall. 1.46 height.  on both sides.
  ((1.46 * 2) + 1.2 + 1.2) * 3
  15.96

2x bobbins. thin wall
  ((2.8 * 2) + 1.2 + 1.2) * 2
  16

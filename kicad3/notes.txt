FreeCAD Electronic Enclosure Using Simple Parametric Design Techniques

    for spreadsheet use, and easyalias

I designed my first electronics enclosure for 3D printing // FreeCAD + KiCAD complete walkthrough

    - refers to the previous video also . for parametric/spreadsheet design.
    - refers to importance of the tree -> model, part, sketch etc.

    - uses kicad stepup also.

Ok. the reason it screws up when extending/gapping - is because new faces get added.

  and so the face references become wrong.


-----------
draft versus sketch.
  how 

little tabs - that insert into guide holes would kind of be nice.
could have two of them. and then just snip - so can do top and bottom cans.

disadvantage of harkin - is that the shield sits a higher off the board. 
unless a receess was made - around the clamp.


- if we have lines - that are not extruded - eg. a draft - then 



  - Draft to sketch: converts Draft objects to Sketcher Sketches and vice versa.

  - can we view a draft and sketch at the same time.






-------
both alumninum or steel can do 0.8mm.  good.

- we want to shrink the outline . about half the width. on each edge.

adc  can.   the ref is about 6mm .  which needs plastic enclosure.  so 10mm. should be fine.


Merge points - into single polygon - 
  - issue is that we have four separate lines. while we want only single vertices between two lines.

  Now that we have a sketch, we can fix the precision issue with the end points.
  Still in either the Part Design or Sketcher workbench, select Sketch005 then
  open the Part Design/Sketch menu and select Validate sketch.

  Under Missing coincidences, set the tolerance to 0.01 and click on the "Find"
  button. A dialog will report 4 missing coincidences found. Click OK to close,
  then click on "Fix" button in the sidebar.

adjust the dimensions -
  adc-can    eg. half radius - distributed over two ends.
  shrink vertical 57.15mm - 2.4 =  54.75 
  shrink horiz    109.85 - 2.4  = 107.45 // 0.8.


we need to have the thing centred.


Symmetry,
   Select one corner, then the opposite corner, then the origin, then apply the
  symmetry constraint. This is one point/point/point constraint as ...
